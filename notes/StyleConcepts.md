## ðŸŽ¨ Artwork Style Concepts

The application features 15 distinct rendering styles, each interpreting the extracted color palette with a unique conceptual intent.

- **Stripes (kinetic):** Creates **dynamic movement** using randomized, overlapping bands of color and rotation.
- **Blobs (soft):** Generates an **organic, hazy, or atmospheric** effect with soft-edged, overlapping radial gradients.
- **Shards (geometric):** Produces a **fragmented, sharp, and structured** look using random, semi-transparent polygonal shapes.
- **Bauhaus Grid Composition:** Emphasizes **geometric stability and abstract formalism** within a rigid grid structure.
- **Diagonal Lines:** Focuses on **linear motion and direction** through a series of sweeping, parallel lines.
- **Pixel Weave (Texture):** Simulates a **textile-like, woven surface** by interlacing randomized horizontal and vertical strips on a grid.
- **Contour Lines (Topographical):** Draws **organic, winding lines** that suggest elevation changes or topographical features.
- **Stained Glass (Tessellation):** Fills the canvas with **irregular, dark-outlined patches** of color to mimic leaded glass.
- **Wave Collapse (Horizontal Flow):** Suggests **gentle, liquid-like flow** using layered horizontal bands with internal gradients and noise.
- **Halftone Grid (Density):** Creates a **classic printing texture** where the size of dots varies with the color's luminance.
- **Rectilinear Stack (Architectural):** Builds structured, **architectural forms** from randomly layered, orthogonal rectangles.
- **Neon Glow (Minimalist Light):** Simulates **luminous, colored light tubes** using simple shapes, heavy blur, and an additive glow effect.
- **Field Tracer (Flow):** Generates **curving particle paths** that follow an invisible, mathematically defined flow field.
- **Recursive Fractal Growth:** Depicts **natural, branching growth patterns** generated by a recursive algorithm.
- **Woven Tessellation (Interlocked):** Creates a complex **basket-weave illusion** by alternating which color strips pass over and under at intersections.
