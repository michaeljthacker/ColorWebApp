## ðŸŽ¨ Artwork Style Concepts

The application features 15 distinct rendering styles, each interpreting the extracted color palette with a unique conceptual intent.

- **Stripes (kinetic):** Creates **dynamic movement** using randomized, overlapping bands of color and rotation.
- **Blobs (soft):** Generates an **organic, hazy, or atmospheric** effect with soft-edged, overlapping radial gradients.
- **Shards (geometric):** Produces a **fragmented, sharp, and structured** look using random, semi-transparent polygonal shapes.
- **Bauhaus Grid Composition:** Inspired by the **Bauhaus and De Stijl movements**, emphasizes **geometric stability, functional minimalism, and abstract formalism** within a rigid grid structure. Reflects the early 20th century modernist principles of Mondrian, van Doesburg, and the Bauhaus school.
- **Diagonal Lines:** Focuses on **linear motion and direction** through a series of sweeping, parallel lines.
- **Pixel Weave (Texture):** Simulates a **textile-like, woven surface** by interlacing randomized horizontal and vertical strips on a grid.
- **Sunburst Radials (Organic Energy):** Creates **radiating energy patterns** with concentric rings and flowing rays emanating from multiple focal points, evoking **solar flares, organic growth patterns, and natural energy fields** through layered radial compositions.
- **Glass Mosaic (Luminous):** Creates **luminous glass-like polygonal pieces** with internal highlights and bold dark outlines, evoking **mosaic art traditions and illuminated glass work** through scattered, gem-like fragments that capture and reflect light.
- **Wave Collapse (Horizontal Flow):** Suggests **gentle, liquid-like flow** using layered horizontal bands with internal gradients and noise.
- **Halftone Grid (Density):** Recreates the **classic Ben-Day dot printing technique** popularized in comic books and pop art (notably Roy Lichtenstein's work), where dot size varies with color luminance to create tonal gradations and vintage print media aesthetics.
- **Rectilinear Stack (Architectural):** Builds structured, **architectural forms** from randomly layered, orthogonal rectangles.
- **Neon Glow (Minimalist Light):** Captures the **electric vibrancy of urban nightlife and vintage signage**, simulating **luminous, colored light tubes** using simple shapes, heavy blur, and additive glow effects reminiscent of 1980s cyberpunk aesthetics and modern LED art installations.
- **Field Tracer (Flow):** Generates **curving particle paths** that follow an invisible, mathematically defined flow field.
- **Recursive Fractal Growth:** Depicts **natural, branching growth patterns** found in trees, coral, lightning, and biological systems, generated through recursive mathematical algorithms that mirror the self-similar structures prevalent throughout nature.
- **Woven Tessellation (Interlocked):** Creates a complex **basket-weave illusion** by alternating which color strips pass over and under at intersections.
